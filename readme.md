# Parsons CD web dev handbook
This website will host web development tutorials written by CD tutors and core interaction faculty to answer common questions and introduce students to best practices

## Possible general pages:
- [ ] General best practices
  - Code indentation and formatting
  - Proper image sizing
  - Breakpoints
- [ ] Debugging
  - Introduction to the inspect tool and web console in browsers
  - *Note: this is a basic skill that I've noticed many students lack*
- [ ] CSS is more powerful than you think
  - Introduction to CSS variables and advanced selectors
- [ ] "Should I use a library?"
  - A guide for how to decide when to build something from scratch or use a library, maybe an index of common applications that are way simpler through a library.
- [ ] "When and how to use code you find online"
  - Explains why it's usually bad to just copy code from places
    - a detriment to learning, defeats the whole point of the assignments
    - possibly plagiaristic
    - introduces dependencies to your code
    - may break things because you don't understand it
  - Explains cases where it's okay
    - Using a *library* to do something that would otherwise be really complicated (link to libraries page)
    - General open source culture
  - Alternatives:
    - Study the code of the site or tutorial that does what you want and try to figure it out, using the inspect tool if necessary
    - Ask for assistance from tutors and instructor


## Possible tutorials:
- [ ] Drag and drop
  - Basic implementation using onmousedown/move/up (not the actual drag API, which is terrible)
  - Snapping, at which point a library will probably be advisable
- [ ] Audio effects
- [ ] Make page respond to screen size or device (media queries)
- [ ] Using APIs
  - Maybe include a list of good APIs
- [ ] Mouse events (make things happen when you click or hover)
  - Explain event listeners, and link to "Dynamically change page elements" for more detail on what can be done with them.
- [ ] Infinite carousels
  - will probably require a library
- [ ] Dynamically change page elements


## Best practices for tutorials:
- [ ] Use titles that are explanatory for people who don't know the right terminology
